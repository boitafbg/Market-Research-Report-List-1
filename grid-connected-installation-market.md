<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grid-connected Installation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Battery</li><li>Without Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Grid-connected installations refer to solar energy systems that connect to the utility grid. The market can be divided into two primary types: with battery and without battery. </p><p>With battery systems incorporate energy storage, allowing excess solar energy to be stored for use during peak demand or outages, enhancing energy reliability and independence. Without battery systems directly feed solar electricity into the grid, often benefiting from net metering but lacking backup power during outages. Both options cater to different energy needs and preferences.</p></p>
