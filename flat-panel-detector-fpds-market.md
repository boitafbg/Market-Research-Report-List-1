<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Panel Detector (FPDs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect FPD</li><li>Direct FPD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flat Panel Detectors (FPDs) are advanced imaging devices used in medical and industrial applications for capturing high-quality digital images. The market for FPDs is divided into two main types: Indirect FPDs and Direct FPDs. Indirect FPDs utilize a scintillator layer to convert X-rays into visible light, which is then detected by a photodiode. In contrast, Direct FPDs use a semiconductor material that converts X-rays directly into electrical signals, offering improved sensitivity and faster image acquisition. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing imaging capabilities.</p></p>
