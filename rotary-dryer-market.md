<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct-heated Rotary Dryer</li><li>Indirect Rotary Dryer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rotary dryer market encompasses two primary types: direct-heated and indirect rotary dryers. Direct-heated rotary dryers utilize a heat source directly in contact with the material, promoting efficient drying through high-temperature air or gases. In contrast, indirect rotary dryers keep the heat source separate to minimize direct contact, using heated walls to evaporate moisture. Both types are widely used across various industries, including agriculture, mining, and chemical processing, catering to specific drying needs and material characteristics.</p></p>
