<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Renal Colic Treatment Equipments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL)</li><li>Ureteroscopy (URS)</li><li>Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The renal colic treatment equipment market includes three primary types: Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL), Ureteroscopy (URS), and Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL). ESWL utilizes acoustic waves to break kidney stones into smaller fragments. URS involves a small scope passed through the urethra to remove stones directly. PCNL is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that allows for larger stones to be extracted through a small incision in the back. Each method offers distinct advantages based on stone size and location.</p></p>
