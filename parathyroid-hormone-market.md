<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Parathyroid Hormone Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hypocalcemia</li><li>Hypoparathyroidism</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Parathyroid Hormone market encompasses treatments for conditions like hypocalcemia and hypoparathyroidism. Hypocalcemia, characterized by low calcium levels, may require hormone therapy to restore balance and prevent complications. Hypoparathyroidism, where parathyroid hormone secretion is insufficient, leads to chronic calcium deficiency, necessitating ongoing treatment. Both markets focus on hormone replacement therapies that enhance calcium absorption and maintain bone health. The increasing prevalence of these conditions drives demand for effective therapeutic solutions and innovation in treatment options.</p></p>
