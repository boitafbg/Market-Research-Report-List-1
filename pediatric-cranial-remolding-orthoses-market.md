<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pediatric Cranial Remolding Orthoses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Helmets</li><li>Passive Helmets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pediatric Cranial Remolding Orthoses market is primarily divided into active and passive helmets. Active helmets use dynamic mechanisms to apply continuous pressure on specific areas of the infant's skull, promoting even growth. In contrast, passive helmets provide a more static fit, allowing for natural growth while protecting the head from external forces. Both types are designed to treat cranial deformities such as plagiocephaly, helping to ensure healthy cranial development in infants during critical growth stages.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Pediatric Cranial Remolding Orthoses Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plagiocephaly</li><li>Brachycephaly</li><li>Scaphocephaly</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pediatric Cranial Remolding Orthoses market targets conditions like plagiocephaly, brachycephaly, and scaphocephaly, which involve abnormal head shapes in infants. Plagiocephaly results in a flat spot on one side of the head, while brachycephaly causes a wide, short head shape. Scaphocephaly, on the other hand, is characterized by a long and narrow head. These orthoses are designed to gently reshape the skull as the child grows, correcting these conditions and promoting normal head development, enhancing both aesthetics and health outcomes.</p></p>
